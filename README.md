# CODSOFT_SEPT_TASK1

## Happy to share my 1st task as UI/UX intern at CodSoft .
 - A successful mobile app signup flow should be quick, easy, and personalized, using the user's details to enhance engagement. It should collect only essential information, be error-free, and prioritize security to build trust and ensure a smooth user experience.
